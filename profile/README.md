# BasisVR
**Basis lets you set up your own Social VR and Networked VR games with ease.**

We are a MIT Licensed Open-Source project with a focus on open development and full access to any optional modification desired or required.
Our goal is to help equip VR Creators, so we can accelerate the growth of VR.
